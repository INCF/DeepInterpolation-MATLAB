# Custom Datastore & Workflow Demo

In this branch I added a custom datastore (and the many tests suggested by the Matlab Documentation) that can be used to train the Deepinterpolation-MATLAB model without memory limitations arising from the huge multi-dimensional training matrix.
Please see the deepint_WorkflowDemo.mlx. There are also simple examples in there how training and inference functions can be made to be used with batch submission of jobs to a cluster.
